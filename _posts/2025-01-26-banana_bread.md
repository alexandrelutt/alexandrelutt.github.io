For one large banana bread, you'll need:

- 2 very ripe bananas
- 100g of white sugar
- 50g of brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 90g of room temperature butter
- 150g of milk (any kind)
- 100g of dark chocolate
- 5g of sea salt
- 5g of cinnamon 
- 7g of baking powder
- 185g of flour

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by mashing your bananas, then add the flour with the baking powder, the salt and the cinnamon. In another bowl, cream the butter with both sugars and add the egg. Once everything is fully incorporated, add the mixture to the first bowl. </p>
<p> Then, fold in the dark chocolate and add the milk. You can then bake your cake for 1 hour at 180Â°C. Wait for it to cool off slightly, and enjoy! </p>
