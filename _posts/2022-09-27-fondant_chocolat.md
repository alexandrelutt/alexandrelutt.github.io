![Chocolat fondant](/assets/img/fondant_chocolat.jpg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

For 6 small chocolate fondant(s), you'll need:

- 200g of dark chocolate
- 200g of butter
- 7g of sea salt
- 4 eggs
- 100g of sugar
- 80g of flour

<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Start by melting your butter with your dark chocolate and the salt on a "bain-marie" and let it cool down to room temperature. Meanwhile, mix in the eggs with the sugar and add them to the butter and chocolate mixture. Finally, add in the flour but be careful not to overmix it; stop as soon as you stop seeing any small flour bits. Ideally, let your batter chill in the fridge for at least in hour, but it is optional. At this point, you may also freeze your batter in individual portions and store in the freezer for your next craving! </p>
<p> Otherwise, bake in individual molds for 8-10min at 180Â°C, let it rest for a few minutes (optionaly sprinkle some icing sugar) and enjoy your well-deserved chocolate fondant! </p>
