<p>My name is Alexandre Lutt, and I am a French guy who loves to bake. I had the chance to work as a pastry intern in the 3 Michelin-star restaurant <a href="https://www.closdessens.com">Le Clos des Sens</a> during the summer of 2021, where I learned a lot, and now I want to share my passion with other amateurs from all around the world. Feel free to have a look at my recipes <a href="https://alexandrelutt.github.io/pages/pastry/">here</a>, or check my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/au_relais_croustillant/">Instagram</a>!</p>
